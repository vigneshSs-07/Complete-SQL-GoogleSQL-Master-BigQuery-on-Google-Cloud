## üß† What is `SAFE_CAST` in BigQuery?

In BigQuery, the standard `CAST()` function is used to convert a value from one data type to another ‚Äî for example, converting a string to an integer or a float.

However, if the conversion **fails** (for example, trying to cast `"apple"` to `INT64`), the query **throws an error** and stops executing.

That‚Äôs where `SAFE_CAST()` comes in.
`SAFE_CAST()` performs the same type conversion, but **instead of throwing an error**, it **returns `NULL`** when the conversion is invalid.

### üß© Syntax

```sql
SAFE_CAST(expression AS target_data_type [format_clause])
```

* `expression`: The value you want to convert
* `target_data_type`: The target SQL type (e.g., `INT64`, `FLOAT64`, `DATE`, etc.)
* `format_clause`: (optional) Used for special cases like byte/string encoding

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example 1: Invalid conversion

Ever had your query fail because of a bad `CAST`? üò¨

```sql
SELECT CAST("apple" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;
```

This throws an error because `"apple"` can‚Äôt be converted to a number.

Enter `SAFE_CAST` üçè‚û°Ô∏è‚ú®

With `SAFE_CAST`, you can *safely* attempt the conversion ‚Äî and if it fails, it simply returns `NULL` instead of breaking your query:

```sql
SELECT SAFE_CAST("apple" AS INT64) AS not_a_number;
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
| not_a_number |
|--------------|
| NULL         |
```

It‚Äôs a small change that can make your pipelines much more resilient ‚Äî especially when dealing with inconsistent or messy data.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example 2: Handling messy transactional data

Let‚Äôs say your transaction data includes unexpected strings or symbols:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataset.transactions_raw AS
SELECT '120.50' AS amount UNION ALL
SELECT 'N/A' UNION ALL
SELECT 'invalid' UNION ALL
SELECT '250.00';
```

If you run:

```sql
SELECT CAST(amount AS FLOAT64) FROM dataset.transactions_raw;
```

‚ùå The query fails ‚Äî because `'N/A'` and `'invalid'` can‚Äôt be converted.

Now use:

```sql
SELECT SAFE_CAST(amount AS FLOAT64) AS amount_cleaned
FROM dataset.transactions_raw;
```

‚úÖ **Result:**

| amount_cleaned |
| -------------- |
| 120.50         |
| NULL           |
| NULL           |
| 250.00         |

This way, your queries, scheduled jobs, and pipelines won‚Äôt break due to bad data.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Example 3: Combining `SAFE_CAST` with logic

You can use `SAFE_CAST` with conditional logic to flag invalid data:

```sql
SELECT
  SAFE_CAST(amount AS FLOAT64) AS amount_cleaned,
  CASE
    WHEN SAFE_CAST(amount AS FLOAT64) IS NULL THEN 'Invalid value'
    ELSE 'Valid value'
  END AS status
FROM dataset.transactions_raw;
```

---

### üèóÔ∏è When to Use `SAFE_CAST`

Use `SAFE_CAST` when:

* You‚Äôre working with **unstructured or external data** (CSV, JSON, APIs)
* **Type mismatches** might occur (e.g., `"N/A"`, `"unknown"`, empty strings)
* You want **fault-tolerant pipelines** in BigQuery Scheduled Queries or Dataflow
* You‚Äôd rather handle invalid data later (via cleaning or validation) than fail the entire job

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

* `SAFE_CAST` does **not** make impossible casts valid ‚Äî 
  for example, `SAFE_CAST(ARRAY[1,2,3] AS STRING)` still fails at parse time.
* It only protects against **runtime conversion errors**, not **syntax errors**.

---

### ‚úÖ **In Summary**

| Function      | Behavior on Invalid Cast | Use Case                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| `CAST()`      | Fails with error         | Strict conversions where all data is clean    |
| `SAFE_CAST()` | Returns `NULL`           | Real-world, messy data ‚Äî prevents job failure |

---

üí° **Best practice:**
Use `SAFE_CAST` in data ingestion, transformation, or cleaning steps ‚Äî especially before aggregations or joins that depend on type conversions.
