🚀 **BigQuery Tip: Quickly Get the Length of an Array with `ARRAY_LENGTH()`**

Working with arrays in BigQuery? One of the most useful — and often overlooked — functions is `ARRAY_LENGTH()`. It helps you quickly find out how many elements are inside an array without needing to unnest or transform the data.

Here’s a simple example 👇

```sql
WITH Sequences AS (
  SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10] AS some_numbers
)
SELECT 
  some_numbers,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(some_numbers) AS len
FROM Sequences;
```

✅ **Result:**

| some_numbers       | len |
| ------------------ | --- |
| [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | 6   |
| [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | 5   |
| [5, 10]            | 2   |

💡 **Why it’s useful:**

* Quickly validate array sizes
* Filter rows based on array length (e.g., `WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(arr) > 3`)
* Simplify downstream logic when dealing with nested data

Perfect for anyone working with semi-structured data in BigQuery.

Absolutely — let’s level this up with **real-world use cases** where `ARRAY_LENGTH()` is genuinely useful in BigQuery 👇

## 🚀 Real-Life Use Cases for `ARRAY_LENGTH()` in BigQuery

When working with nested or semi-structured data (like JSON, arrays, or repeated fields), counting array elements becomes essential. Here are a few **practical scenarios** you’ll encounter:

---

### 1️⃣ Track the Number of Items in a Customer’s Order

**Use case:** You have an `orders` table where each order stores the list of purchased items as an array.

```sql
SELECT 
  order_id,
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(items) AS total_items
FROM ecommerce.orders;
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Identify large orders (`WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(items) > 10`)
* Understand average cart size
* Segment customers by purchasing behavior

---

### 2️⃣ Count the Number of Tags or Categories Assigned to Content

**Use case:** A `blog_posts` table has a `tags` array column.

```sql
SELECT 
  post_id,
  title,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(tags) AS tag_count
FROM content.blog_posts;
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Filter posts with too few or too many tags
* Analyze tagging trends
* Ensure metadata completeness

---

### 3️⃣ Measure Engagement: How Many Devices per User?

**Use case:** A `users` table contains a repeated field `device_ids` listing all devices a user has logged in from.

```sql
SELECT 
  user_id,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(device_ids) AS total_devices
FROM analytics.users;
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Detect multi-device users
* Spot unusual behavior (e.g., too many devices → possible account sharing)
* Personalize experiences based on device usage

---

### 4️⃣ Event Tracking: Count All Actions per Session

**Use case:** Each row in `web_sessions` stores an array of all user actions.

```sql
SELECT 
  session_id,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(actions) AS total_actions
FROM analytics.web_sessions;
```

✅ **Why it’s useful:**

* Understand session engagement
* Detect inactive sessions
* Build behavioral cohorts

---

💡 **Pro Tip:** Combine `ARRAY_LENGTH()` with conditions for even more power:

```sql
SELECT 
  session_id
FROM analytics.web_sessions
WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(actions) > 50;
```

👉 Find “super-engaged” sessions with more than 50 actions.

---

💭 **In short:** `ARRAY_LENGTH()` isn’t just a utility — it’s a powerful tool to unlock insights from nested data without complex transformations.

💡 **BigQuery Tip: Stop Unnesting – Just Use `ARRAY_LENGTH()` 🚀**

Working with arrays in BigQuery? You *don’t* always need to unnest them just to know how many items they hold.

👉 The `ARRAY_LENGTH()` function makes it super easy to count elements directly — and it’s incredibly useful in real-world scenarios.

---

### 🔍 Quick Example

```sql
WITH Sequences AS (
  SELECT [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] AS some_numbers
  UNION ALL SELECT [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
  UNION ALL SELECT [5, 10]
)
SELECT 
  some_numbers,
  ARRAY_LENGTH(some_numbers) AS len
FROM Sequences;
```

✅ **Result:**

| some_numbers       | len |
| ------------------ | --- |
| [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5] | 6   |
| [2, 4, 8, 16, 32]  | 5   |
| [5, 10]            | 2   |

💼 **Real-World Use Cases:**

🔹 **E-commerce:** Count total items per order

```sql
SELECT order_id, ARRAY_LENGTH(items) AS total_items FROM orders;
```

🔹 **Content Platforms:** Count tags assigned to a blog

```sql
SELECT post_id, ARRAY_LENGTH(tags) AS tag_count FROM blog_posts;
```

🔹 **User Analytics:** How many devices a user logged in from

```sql
SELECT user_id, ARRAY_LENGTH(device_ids) AS devices FROM users;
```

🔹 **Event Tracking:** Total actions in a session

```sql
SELECT session_id, ARRAY_LENGTH(actions) AS total_actions FROM sessions;
```

---

✨ **Pro Tips:**

* Combine with `WHERE` to filter (`WHERE ARRAY_LENGTH(items) > 10`)
* Great for validation and quality checks
* Helps segment and analyze data **without unnesting**

---

💡 Arrays are everywhere in modern data — and `ARRAY_LENGTH()` is one of those *simple but powerful* tools every data engineer should have in their BigQuery toolkit.
