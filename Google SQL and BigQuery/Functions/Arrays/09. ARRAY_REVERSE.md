💡 **Quick BigQuery Tip: Reversing an Array Made Easy!**

Ever needed to flip an array in BigQuery? Maybe to reorder data or just make sense of a sequence?
Here’s a neat function that BigQuery provides a straightforward built-in function to do it in one line 👇

🧠 **Function Overview:**
`ARRAY_REVERSE(value)` returns a new array with elements in the reverse order of the input.

**Return Type:**
`ARRAY`

✨ **What it does:**
`ARRAY_REVERSE()` takes your array and returns it in reverse order — simple, clean, and super useful when working with ordered data or time-based arrays.

```sql
SELECT ARRAY_REVERSE([1, 2, 3]) AS reverse_arr;
```

**Output:**
```
[3, 2, 1]
```

When working with arrays in BigQuery, reversing element order can be particularly useful for time-series analysis, customer behavior tracking, or sequence evaluation.

Let’s walk through a practical example. 👇

```sql
-- Step 1: Create a sample table
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE dataset.customer_activity AS
SELECT 1 AS customer_id, [100, 200, 300, 400] AS purchase_values
UNION ALL
SELECT 2 AS customer_id, [50, 75, 125] AS purchase_values;

-- Step 2: View the data
SELECT * FROM dataset.customer_activity;

-- Step 3: Reverse the array order
SELECT
  customer_id,
  ARRAY_REVERSE(purchase_values) AS reversed_purchases
FROM dataset.customer_activity;
```

🧮 **Output:**

| customer_id | reversed_purchases   |
| ----------- | -------------------- |
| 1           | [400, 300, 200, 100] |
| 2           | [125, 75, 50]        |

💡 **Why this matters:**
`ARRAY_REVERSE()` is especially useful when analyzing events or transactions in reverse chronological order — for example, to quickly identify the *most recent* customer actions or evaluate trends backward in time.

**Common Use Cases:**

* Reversing time-series data for chronological analysis
* Flipping the order of aggregated arrays (e.g., from `ARRAY_AGG()` results)
* Performing comparative analysis between ascending and descending sequences

This function is simple yet powerful for maintaining flexible control over array-based operations in BigQuery.

🔍 **Pro tip:** Combine it with `ARRAY_AGG()` (with `ORDER BY`) to reverse query results dynamically!
